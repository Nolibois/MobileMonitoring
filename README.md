# MobileMonitoring

My project provides customers an asset to quickly view data that takes up a lot of space in the system ***Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations***, resulting in wasted storage space, and decreased application performance.
	A dashboard will provide a global view of all modules used by the customer. Each of these business modules can be viewed in detail and the ability to delete unwanted data will be integrated.
 
The project must be created in desktop application and in mobile version. However, the mobile part is no longer part of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and operations applications since June 2022. Therefore, the creation of a new mobile application will serve as a dashboard, with the additional possibility to set a custom alert threshold depending on the desktop part.
